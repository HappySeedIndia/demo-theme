# libraries load alphabetically

# Lower weight = earlier processing/display and Higher weight = later processing/display.

# While individual assets within a library can be weighted, 
# the overall order in which libraries themselves are loaded can also be 
# influenced by the weight assigned to the library within its definition.

# Module styles are always loaded before theme styles

# Min and max values: Documentation suggests using a numeric value 
# between -50 and 50 for manual weight overrides.
